    <h2>
      A light and creamy sauce with puree of roasted red peppers as the base. It
      is excellent on any type of pasta, but tortellini or ravioli seems to be
      the best match. The prep time is rather long, but the result is definitely
      worth it. Freezes well. In fact, the taste may improve slightly.

    <ul>
      <li>2 large red bell peppers</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>

      <li>¼ cup fresh basil</li>

      <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>

      <li>2 cups half-and-half</li>

      <li>¼ cup grated Romano cheese</li>

      <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>

      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat broiler. Lightly coat the red peppers with olive oil. Grill
        peppers under the broiler until the skin is blackened, and the flesh has
        softened slightly. Place peppers in a paper bag or resealable plastic
        bag to cool for approximately 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the seeds and skin from the peppers (the skin should come off the
        peppers easily now). Cut peppers into small pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a skillet, cook and stir the garlic, basil, and red peppers in 3
        tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Cook for 10 minutes, so that the
        flavors mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place mixture in blender (careful it is hot), and puree to desired
        consistency. Return puree to skillet, and reheat to a boil. Stir in the
        half-and-half and the Romano cheese; cook and stir until the cheese
        melts. Add the butter, and stir until melted. Season with salt and
        pepper to taste. Simmer for 5 minutes.
